# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Primary Directive

**ALWAYS read and follow the standards defined in `docs/STANDARDS.md` before performing any development work.**

## Workflow

1. At the beginning of each work session or major task, read `docs/STANDARDS.md`
2. Apply all architectural, security, and code quality principles defined therein
3. When in doubt about implementation approach, refer back to the standards
4. If standards conflict with user requests, discuss with the user before proceeding

## Enforcement

The standards in `docs/STANDARDS.md` are not suggestions - they are requirements for this project. Violations should be caught by:
- Automated linting and formatting tools
- Type checking systems
- Code review processes
- Your adherence as the AI assistant

## Planning Guidelines

- **No Timelines**: Do not include time estimates, week numbers, or deadlines in plans or documentation. Focus on quality and correctness, not speed.
- **Focus on Quality**: Emphasize building each component correctly rather than quickly.
- **Sequential Phases**: Break work into logical phases with clear deliverables, but without time constraints.

## Updates

If standards need to be modified or expanded, those changes should be made to `docs/STANDARDS.md` and will automatically apply to future work.
