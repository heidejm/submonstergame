# Submarine Monster Tactical Game

A turn-based tactical combat game inspired by Kingdom Death: Monster, featuring submarines fighting ocean monsters in true 3D space.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning & Setup
**Version**: Pre-alpha (v0.0.0)

This project is in early development. The goal is to build a minimal playable prototype (v0.1.0) that demonstrates:
- 3D grid-based tactical combat in underwater environment
- Turn-based gameplay with 1-4 player-controlled submarines
- AI-controlled monsters
- Kingdom Death-inspired mechanics (adapted for digital play)

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS
- **Language**: C#
- **Networking**: Mirror (for future multiplayer)
- **Platforms**: PC (Windows/Mac/Linux) initially, cross-platform later

## Project Philosophy

This project follows strict development standards to ensure:
- **No vibe coding** - proper architecture and planning first
- **Clean separation of concerns** - game logic independent of Unity
- **Scalability** - designed for multiplayer from day one
- **Security** - proper input validation and secure practices
- **Maintainability** - comprehensive documentation and testing

See [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) for complete development guidelines.
